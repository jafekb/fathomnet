first: exactly copied Alexander Merdian-Tarko's code
    almost perfectly replicated his results.
second: increase batch size to 35, increased n epochs
    but it didn't matter bc early stopping intervened after 8 epochs...
third: replaced efficientnet_v2_m with efficientnet_v2_l. Had to decrease batch size to 16
    Only trained for 12 epochs bc I ran out of time. But the performance is better
fourth: same as third but leave it running for longer
    Early stopping ended it after 9 epochs...
fifth: same as fourth but remove the early stopping, let it run out its full 100 epochs.

sixth: BioCLIP embeddings zero-shot KNN, K=9
seventh: BioCLIP embeddings zero-shot KNN, K=25
eighth: BioCLIP embeddings zero-shot KNN, K=3

ninth: Totally random just as a sanity check on the BioCLIP ones


FUTURE WORK
1. use BioCLIP - clip embeddings but for biological things
    https://imageomics.github.io/bioclip/
    use some feature reduction technique to get it down to 2D so we can visualize the spread.
    use the centroid of all the examples? what's some like probabilistic KNN technique?
2. visualization
    a. for train
    b. for eval
    c. Show the BioCLIP embeddings in 2D with names and predictions.

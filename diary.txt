TODO have to re-download the data bc I was running out of space...


first: exactly copied Alexander Merdian-Tarko's code
    almost perfectly replicated his results.

second: increase batch size to 35, increased n epochs
    but it didn't matter bc early stopping intervened after 8 epochs...

third: replaced efficientnet_v2_m with efficientnet_v2_l. Had to decrease batch size to 16
    Only trained for 12 epochs bc I ran out of time. But the performance is better

fourth: same as third but leave it running for longer
    Early stopping ended it after 9 epochs...

fifth: same as fourth but remove the early stopping, let it run out its full 100 epochs.


FUTURE WORK
1. use BioCLIP - clip embeddings but for biological things
    https://imageomics.github.io/bioclip/
    use some feature reduction technique to get it down to 2D so we can visualize the spread.
    use the centroid of all the examples? what's some like probabilistic KNN technique?
2. visualization
    for train
    for eval
